Variables declared within setup() are not accessible within other functions, including draw().
Called directly after setup(), the draw() function continuously executes the lines of code contained inside its block 
until the program is stopped or noLoop() is called.

so, if we put class inside setup, then even we change the value inside it afterwards, which means 
so we have to declear variables out side the set up.
put inside draw, it will renew the time for each loop, the graph won't move at all.
